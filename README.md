> [!CAUTION]

> AWS recommends to take backups of EC2 before changing instance types and make sure to check with vendor to ensure compatibility and supportability before migrating your instances.

> [!NOTE]
> You can always manually change the instance back to its original type. 


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check cost by using Cost Explorer or the Cost and Usage Report (CUR). Cost Explorer and CUR billing data are delayed by ~48hours, after ~2days you will be able to visualize the savings.
